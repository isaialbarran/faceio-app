# Authentication system with FaceIO

## Explanation

There are 5 ways of authenticate in a web site.

1. **Email-password based authentication**
2. **Phone authentication**
3. **OAuth-based authentication**
4. **Magic link authentication**
5. **Facial recognition authentication**

In this project we focus on the last one. Using the fio.js JavaScript library.

Is a very simple project. You need to sign-in, allowing the web browser to use your camera. Create a pin code and that's it, you are in.

Is an example of what we can do with this library and implement this authentication in different web pages.
